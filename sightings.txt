test scheme #1
- look for the second peak, discarding those with the same polarity
- should look at to which degree the angle effects the prediction

has a good split, high degree of accuracy with spiradic movements
-ve gradient will likely be left (83%) and +ve likely right (89%)

test scheme #2
- look for the second peak without discarding
- should probably take the second peaks out of the bound condition for the first peak
- gain at 3 and the threshold at 0.0075 for variance ([2, 59], [63, 5]) for each split [r,l] at the root node.
- the peaks are binary values.
- with continuous data ([55,5], [54, 6]) splits
